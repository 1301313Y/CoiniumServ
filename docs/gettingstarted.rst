Getting Started

Requirements
============

CoiniumServ is an platform-agnostic software which can either run over mono or .net. To get CoiniumServ running, all you have to do is ensuring you do have either mono or .net installed on your system;

* Linux/Unix over [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).
* MacOS over [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).
* Windows over [.Net](http://www.microsoft.com/net).

Once you do have either mono/.net installed, you can then run CoiniumServ. You have basically two options; compiling from source or using a binary distribution.

Binary Distribution
===================

Our binary distributions can work on any platform including Windows, Linux and MacOS. You can purchase a binary distribution over [here](http://www.coiniumserv.com/shop/releases/coiniumserv/) to support the project.

Once you download the package, extract the contents to a suitable folder;

Then you can simply run the **CoiniumServ.exe**

Then you have to [configure](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Configuration) the server to get it working.

Compiling from source
=====================

If you like you can get the sources of the project and compile yourself.

  * [Windows](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Getting-Started:-Windows)
  * [Linux](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Getting-Started:-Linux)
  * [MacOS](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Getting-Started:-MacOS)

Then you have to [configure](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Configuration) the server to get it working.
